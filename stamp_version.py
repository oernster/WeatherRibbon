"""Stamp the version from VERSION into the WeatherRibbon site.

A browser rendering the site cannot read VERSION, so every place the site shows a
version carries a delimited token: <!--VERSION-->x.y.z<!--/VERSION-->. This script
rewrites whatever sits between the delimiters. VERSION stays the one place a real
version string is written by hand.

The site only, deliberately: docs/**/*.html and docs/**/*.md, the tree GitHub Pages
serves. Markdown at the repository root holds no version by rule, so it is never a
target.

Each page's local stylesheet and script links carry their file's content hash too, as
styles.css?v=<hash>. GitHub Pages lets a browser keep a stylesheet for ten minutes, so
a freshly deployed page could otherwise be drawn with the old one; a changed file is a
new address instead. The hash is taken with CRLF read as LF, so a Windows checkout and
the LF blob GitHub serves agree. A link to a file that does not exist is a failure.

Idempotent. A file already carrying the current version is left alone rather than
rewritten, so a second run changes nothing and says so. Files are read and written as
bytes, so their line endings survive a stamp on any platform.

A missing or empty VERSION is a failure rather than a sentinel: the build calls this
script and has to stop instead of publishing a number nobody chose.
